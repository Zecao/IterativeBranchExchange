--------------------------

#### Released Jun 20, 2019

Below is a summary of the changes since version 6.0 of MATPOWER. See the
[`CHANGES.md`][1] file for all the gory details. For release notes for
previous versions, see Appendix H of the [MATPOWER User's Manual][2].

  updates MATLAB or Octave paths or optionally provides the commands
  required to so.
- Support for additional user-defined general nonlinear constraints and
  costs in AC OPF.
- Support for exporting MATPOWER case to PSS/E RAW data format.
- Three new variants of the standard Newton AC power flow, for a total
  of four, including both nodal power and current balance constraints
  and both polar and cartesian representations of voltage. See the new
  `pf.current_balance` and `pf.v_cartesian` options.
  *Thanks to Baljinnyam Sereeter.*
- Three new variants of the standard AC OPF formulation, for a total of

#### Other Improvements:
- Update versions of included packages:
  - MIPS 1.3.1.
  - MOST 1.0.2.
  - MP-Test 7.0.
- Continuous integration testing via GitHub and Travis-CI integration.

  - general nonlinear costs
  - quadratic costs
- Refactor OPF code to take advantage of new `opt_model` capabilities
  for nonlinear constraints and quadratic and nonlinear costs.
- Derivative functions now support cartesian coordinates for voltage in
  addition to polar coordinates.
- In the Newton power flow, for larger systems use explicit LU
  decomposition with AMD reordering and the 3 output argument form of
  `lu` (to select the Gilbert-Peierls algorithm), resulting in up to a
  2x speedup in MATLAB, 1.1x in Octave. *Thanks to Jose Luis Mar√≠n.*

  `cpf.plot.bus` to take on vector values.
- Add line for curtailed load to `case_info()` output.
- Change default implementation of active power line flow constraints
  (`opf.flow_lim = 'P'`) to use flow directly, rather than square of
  flow, which is now a separate option, namely `opf.flow_lim = '2'`.
  *Thanks to Nico Meyer-Huebner*.
- Add `genfuels` and `gentypes` to establish standard set of values for
  optional `mpc.genfuel` and `mpc.gentype` fields for generator fuel
  type and generator unit type, respectively.

  path.

    - `d2ASbr_dV2()` -- use `dA2br_dV2()` instead.
    - `opt_model/add_constraints()` -- use the corresponding one of the
      following methods instead: `add_lin_constraint()`,
      `add_nln_constraint()`, or `init_indexed_name()`.
    - `opt_model/add_costs()` -- use the corresponding one of the
      following methods instead: `add_quad_cost()`,  `add_nln_cost()`,
      `add_legacy_cost()`, or `init_indexed_name()`.
    - `opt_model/linear_constraints()` -- use

#### Bugs Fixed:
- Fix bug in conversion of older versions of MATPOWER options.
- Fix bug #4 where some Q limits were not being respected by CPF when
  buses were converted to PQ by initial power flow run.
  *Thanks to Shruti Rao.*
- Fix fatal bug #8 when calling `runcpf` with base and target cases
  with identical load and generation. *Thanks to Felix.*
- Fix fatal bug in `get_losses` when computing derivatives of reactive
  branch injections and fix some related tests.
- Fix #11 fatal error encountered when running `test_matpower` with
  `SDP_PF` and YALMIP installed, but no SDP solver. Now checks for
  availability of SeDuMi, SDP3 or MOSEK before attempting to run
  `SDP_PF` tests that require solving an SDP. *Thanks to Felix.*
- Fix bug #12 where the CPF could terminate early when requesting trace
  of the full curve with P or Q limits enforced, if a limit becomes
  binding at the base case. *Thanks to Felix.*
- Fix bug #13 where setting all buses to type `NONE` (isolated)
  resulted in a fatal error for `ext2int`, `runpf`, `runcpf` and
  `runopf`. *Thanks to SNPerkin.*
- Fix bug #21 where a continuation power flow that failed the first
  corrector step would produce a fatal error. *Thanks to Elis Nycander.*
- Fix bug #23 where the continuation power flow could switch directions
  unexpectedly when the operating point switched from stable to
  unstable manifold or vice-versa after hitting a limit.
  *Thanks to Elis Nycander and Shrirang Abhyankar.*
- Fix bug #26 where, in a continuation power flow, a reactive limit at
  a bus could be detected in error if multiple generators at the bus
  had reactive ranges of very different sizes.
  *Thanks to Elis Nycander and Shrirang Abhyankar.*
- Fix `runpf` handling of case where individual power flow fails during
  Q limit enforcement.
- Fix #53 where certain OPF cases (e.g. `case33bw`) resulted in a fatal
  error under versions of MATLAB prior to R2016b (v9.1).
  *Thanks to Jane Cheung.*
- Fix #56 where `save2psse` was missing entries for two transformer
  columns, namely, `VMA1` and `VMI1`.
  *Thanks to Amin Gholami.*
- Fix #57 where `save2psse` always used 1 for the `CKT` number, even for
  parallel branches or transformers.
  *Thanks to Amin Gholami.*
- Fix bug in `have_fcn()` where it would incorrectly mark Gurobi as
  available even if it had an expired license or failed for some other
  reason.
- Fix #60 by adding missing generator at slack bus in RTE cases. Affects
  the following cases:
  - `case1888rte`
  - `case1951rte`
  - `case2848rte`
  - `case2868rte`
  - `case6468rte`
  - `case6470rte`
  - `case6495rte`
  - `case6515rte`
  *Thanks to Jean Maeght.*

#### Incompatible Changes:
- Move included MATPOWER case files to new `data` subdirectory.
- Turning soft limits on without specifying any parameters explicitly
  in `mpc.softlims` now implements soft limits for all constraints,
  by default, not just branch flow limits. And the format of the input
  parameters in `mpc.softlims` has changed. See `help toggle_softlims`
  or Tables 7-9, 7-10 and 7-11 in the [MATPOWER User's Manual][2] for
  the details.
- Swap the order of the output arguments of `dSbus_dV()`) for polar
  coordinate voltages (angle before magnitude) for consistency.
- Correct signs of phase shifter angles in Polish system cases, since
  they were based on the old sign convention used by MATPOWER prior to
  v3.2 (see change on 6/21/07). Affects the following cases:
  - `case2383wp`
  - `case2736sp`
  - `case2737sop`
  - `case2746wop`
  - `case2746wp`
  - `case3375wp`

  *Thanks to Mikhail Khokhlov and Dr. Artjoms Obusevs for reporting.*
- Remove `nln.mu.l.<name>` and `nln.mu.u.<name>` fields from OPF
  `results` struct. Use `nle.lambda.<name>` and `nli.mu.<name>` fields
  instead for nonlinear constraint multipliers.
- Modify order of default output arguments of `opt_model/get_idx()`.
- Add `mpopt` to input args for OPF `'ext2int'`, `'formulation'`, and
  `'int2ext'` callbacks.
- Eliminate unnecessary reordering of on-line generators (sorted by
  increasing bus index) from `ext2int()`. The order is now left
  unmodified by `ext2int()`. This change should only affect user code
  that explicitly depends on the order of generators with internal
  numbering (hopefully quite rare).
