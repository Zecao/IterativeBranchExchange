The SynGrid User's Manual should also be cited explicitly in work that
refers to or is derived from its content. The citation and DOI can be
version-specific or general, as appropriate. For version 1.0.1, use:

  Z. Wang, H. Sadeghian, S. H. Elyas, R. D. Zimmerman, E. Schweitzer,
  A. Scaglione. SynGrid User's Manual, Version 1.0.1. 2019. [Online].
  Available: https://matpower.org/docs/SynGrid-manual-1.0.1.pdf
  doi: 10.5281/zenodo.3251099

For a version non-specific citation, use the following citation and DOI,
with <YEAR> replaced by the year of the most recent release:

  Z. Wang, H. Sadeghian, S. H. Elyas, R. D. Zimmerman, E. Schweitzer,
  A. Scaglione. SynGrid User's Manual. <YEAR>. [Online].
  Available: https://matpower.org/docs/SynGrid-manual.pdf
  doi: 10.5281/zenodo.3238679

A list of versions of the User's Manual with release dates and
version-specific DOI's can be found via the general DOI at
