%
%   Builds the full set of cost parameters from the individual named
%   sub-sets added via ADD_COSTS. Skips the building process if it has
%   already been done, unless a second input argument is present.
%
%   These cost parameters can be retrieved by calling GET_COST_PARAMS
%   and the user-defined costs evaluated by calling COMPUTE_COST.
%
%   See also OPT_MODEL, ADD_COSTS, PARAMS_LEGACY_COST, GET_COST_PARAMS,
%   COMPUTE_COST.
