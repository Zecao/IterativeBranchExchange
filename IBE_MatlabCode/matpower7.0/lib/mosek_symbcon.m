function sc = mosek_symbcon
%MOSEK_SYMBCON  Returns struct containing MOSEK's symbolic constants
%   SC = MOSEK_SYMBCON
%
%   Returns a stuct containing all of MOSEk's symbolic constants, such
%   as those used to select the optimizer algorithm. Since the values
%   of these constants are not necessarily the same from one version of
%   MOSEK to the next, it is safer to use the symbolic constant rather
%   than the value in your MATPOWER code. For example, the following code
%
%       mpopt = mpoption('opf.dc.solver', 'MOSEK', 'mosek_lp_alg', 4);
%
%   would select primal simplex solver in MOSEK v6.x, but dual-simplex in
%   MOSEK v7.x. The recommended way to select a dual-simplex solver that
%   should work regardless of MOSEK version is to use the following:
%
%       sc = mosek_symbcon;
%       mpopt = mpoption('opf.dc.solver', 'MOSEK', ...
%                           'mosek_lp_alg', sc.MSK_OPTIMIZER_DUAL_SIMPLEX);
